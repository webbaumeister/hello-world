# hello-world
Hi folks,
my name is Thomas and i´m a (future) webdeveloper. 
I've been building so far wordpress websites and I have some skills in html and css. 
Actually i´m learnig to build webapplications based on php and sql and i´m looking forward to improve my developing skills.
Maybe in a joint project with you? :)
